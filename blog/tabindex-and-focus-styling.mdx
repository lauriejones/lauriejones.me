In my recent mission to improve my keyboard accessibility practices I came across an interesting behaviour.

I was implementing a skip link when I realised that clicking on an element that has a `tabIndex` attribute it focuses, with whatever outline styling you have or have not established.

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="laurie" data-slug-hash="RBQzKb" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="Tab index of -1 focuses on click">

Clicking on the element directly focuses it

Clicking a jump link to the element also focuses it

When trying to manage focus for your user you may need to "throw focus" to a  

This was not the behaviour I expected. It can be easily resolved by removing the outline styling when focused.

```css
:focus {
  outline: none;
}
```

**!important:** This is a very particular scenario where removing focus styling is desired. We only want to remove this outline from the `div` or `main` or whatever other non-interactive element with a `tabIndex` specified.

You could try to be clever about this with some CSS selector fanciness, but it's probably best to handle on a case-by-case basis.

```css
[tabindex='-1']:focus {
  outline: none;
}
```

```css
[tabindex='-1']:not(a):not(button):not(input):focus {
  outline: none;
}
```
