I hope you like it. It took me a long time on this Saturday afternoon. I should be gardening right now.

Welcome to your blog, Laurie! 

In 2019 there was a movement of web-folk bringing back the personal blog. I'm a bit late to the party, was just waiting for a global pandemic to provide me with the motivation. 

I've often thought about creating a blog for myself

self-doubt about whether I have something useful to say, beyond all the other voices already out there.

One tip that's stuck with me to combat these feelings of self-doubt, is to write for yourself. Write to concrete your thoughts. Write to have a reference for the next time you come across the problem. Write to clarify a solution that you learned from sombody else's post. If other people read what you write and find value in it, well then that's just a wonderful bonus.

Blogging hasn't been vacant in the last 5 years, but it had moved to platforms like medium that made the whole process so much simpler and gauranteed more of an audience.

Fast forward a few years and paywalls and other questionable practices later, the concept of content ownership 

I for onw am

If bychance your name happens to be Laurie, then this is doubly for you.


Maybe I should finally get around to using RSS...
