25 April is ANZAC Day in Australia and New Zealand. ANZAC Day is a memorial for WW1 veterans from Australia and New Zealand and in 2020 with the country and the world in various degrees of lockdown, it was a little different.

ANZAC Day is the only day of the year where the game of "Two-Up" is legal in pubs. For those unfamiliar, it is basically betting on the result of two coins being tossed. You can bet that both coins are **Heads** or **Tails**, one of each is a bad throw.

The fun part is that you're not betting against the house, you have to find someone in the crowd willing to bet the same amount as you, on the opposite result.

With all pubs and RSLs closed and gatherings banned I decided to build a quick virtual verison. Luckily the rules of the game could not be simpler and I managed to get something together in a few hours.

I got myself into trouble trying to animate the flipping of the coins using `backface-visibility` and the whole animation is completely borked in safari, and all iphone browsers ðŸ˜©

So give it a try on something other than that
