What does composability mean.

Again, I'll use an example from nib's Mesh Design System. At nib we have a standard `Header` and `Footer` component, and a layout component, `HeaderFooterLayout` that is basically and old-school sticky footer component to ensure that the footer remains at the bottom of the user's screen even if the content isn't enough to fill the screen. 

This is what makes Brent Jackson's [styled-system](#) so great.
