Welcome to your blog, Laurie <Emoji label="wave">ðŸ‘‹</Emoji>. I hope you like it. It took me a long time on this Saturday afternoon. I should be gardening right now.

In 2019 I was excited to witness a movement of web-folk bringing back the personal blog. I'm fashionably late to the party in 2020 &mdash; was just waiting for a global pandemic to provide me with the motivation &mdash; but the second-best time to start a blog is right now! 

I've often considered creating a blog for myself but the usual feelings of self-doubt always kicked in about whether I have something useful to say, beyond all the other voices already out there.

One piece of advice that's stuck with me to combat these insecurites is to write for yourself, not everyone else. Write to concrete your thoughts. Write to have a reference for the next time you come across the same problem. Write to clarify a solution that you learned from somebody else's post. It's okay to say something that has been said before. And if other people read what you write and find value in it, well then that's just a wonderful bonus.

That is why the title of this inaugural post is addressed to Laurie and not the world. If by some slim chance your name happens to be Laurie, then this can be for you, too.
