I spend my days maintaining and (hopefully) improving the nib design system, Mesh. We have had a design system, in one form or another, since before I started here 5 years ago.

Pattern Library - many individual github repos. Sometimes two repos for a single component; one for the javascript logic and one for the styles written in scss.

Moved to single packages for each component, using the css-in-js library Styled Components.

Moved to a monorepo to enable changes across the system more easily. Changes to many interconnected packages can now be made in a single PR.

The documentation website, unfortunately is not part of this and often lags behind the current state of the components. Not great!

We have begun the migration to have these docs part of same monorepo.



I often think, if we were to start anew tomorrow building a design system, what would that look like? What tools would we use?

- design tokens &#8482;
- storybook - doc blocks
- monorepo / single package - compatibility for your users.
- changesets?
- vanilla css / atomic or css-in-js. React? or html?
- styled system! System props!
- theme support is a must have. Dark mode/multi-brand
