We have a design system built in react and the css-in-js solution, styled components.

With layout components, and 50+ components, we rarely need to write CSS.

Utilities / primitives.

## Components, mixins and primitives

Three approaches to the same problem. Let's take a simple concern like centering some text and walk through how each would approach it.

### Components



```jsx
const Center = styled.p`
  text-align: center;
`;
```

```jsx
import {Center} from './components';

<Center>
  I'm centred!
</Center>
```

### Mixins


```jsx
const Center = css`
  text-align: center;
`;
```

```jsx
import {textCenter} from './mixins';

const MyParagraph = styled.p`
  ${textCenter};
`;

<MyParagraph>
  I'm centred!
</MyParagraph>
```

### Primitives (core props available across the system)

Primitives are a core system of props that can be made available to your components.

This predictability of API is extremely powerful. It's also 

[Styled System](#) and [ThemeUI](#) both 

```jsx
import {Text} from './components';

<Text align="center" color="brand.500">
  I'm centred! And blue!
</Text>
```

The greatest strength of this approach is the predictability of the API means when you need to change the alignment and color of another system component, you already know how:

```jsx
import {Box} from './components';

<Box align="center" color="grey.300">
  I'm centred! And grey!
</Box>
```
